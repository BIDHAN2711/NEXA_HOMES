# 🏠 NexaHomes – Smart Gateway to Real Estate & Home Financing

## 📌 Project Summary

**NexaHomes** is a startup project developed as part of a live server deployment during an internship. The landing page serves as a smart, centralized entry point to two core services:

This responsive and dynamic website blends modern UI/UX with backend functionality. It’s built with scalability in mind using a tech stack that includes **HTML5**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Bootstrap 5**, **PHP**, and **MySQL**.
